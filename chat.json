Protons are baryons and are made of two up quarks and one down quark. They are found in the nucleus of every atom. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the element's atomic number and thus the chemical element to which the atom belongs. Protons are stable and do not decay on their own.", "timestamp": "2025-09-14T23:39:11.259701"}]}]
