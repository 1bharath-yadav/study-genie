The process begins with astronomical data, typically stored in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format, which bundles image data with crucial metadata like celestial coordinates. The core library for this work is Astropy, which provides a robust toolkit for reading FITS files, handling physical units, and performing coordinate transformations using the World Coordinate System (WCS). The numerical data of the image itself, which is a large array of pixel values, is manipulated and analyzed using the power of the NumPy library. A primary technique for measurement is photometry—the science of measuring the brightness (or flux) of celestial objects. This is often done via aperture photometry, where the light within a defined circle around the galaxy is summed, and the sky background is subtracted. The results can be visualized using Matplotlib, which is used to display images and plot data, such as a galaxy's light profile. From these measurements, astronomers can infer properties like a galaxy's size, luminosity, and, by measuring its cosmological redshift, its distance via Hubble's Law."",""metadata"":{""chapter_name"":""Computational Astrophysics"",""concept_name"":""Measuring Galaxies with Python"",""subject_name"":""Astronomy"",""difficulty_level"":""Medium"",""estimated_study_time"":""1-2 hours""},""flashcards"":[{""answer"":""A core Python library for astronomy, providing tools and utilities for data analysis, file handling (like FITS), and coordinate transformations."",""question"":""What is the role of the Astropy library in astronomical measurements?"",""difficulty"":""Easy"",""key_concepts"":""Astropy Library"",""key_concepts_data"":""Astropy is an open-source, community-developed library that offers a vast collection of modules for astronomers.
